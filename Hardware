### 🔁 Relay Module

| Relay Pin | ESP32 Pin |
| --------- | --------- |
| VCC       | 5V        |
| GND       | GND       |
| IN        | GPIO 25   |

### 💧 Water Pump

* Pump **positive (+)** → Relay **NO (Normally Open)**
* Relay **COM** → External Power Supply **positive (+)**
* Pump **negative (–)** → External Power Supply **negative (–)**

> ⚠️ The pump uses an external power supply to protect the ESP32 from high current.

## ⚙️ Operation / Working

* The soil moisture sensor sends an **analog signal** to the ESP32.
* ESP32 continuously monitors the moisture level.
* When moisture falls **below the defined threshold**:

  * ESP32 sends a **HIGH** signal to the relay.
  * Relay activates and the **water pump turns ON**.
* When the soil becomes sufficiently moist:

  * ESP32 sends a **LOW** signal to the relay.
  * Relay deactivates and the **pump turns OFF**.
* The system operates **fully automatically** without manual control.
